# RethinkDB on ARM32v7

This repository uses GitHub Actions to trigger a self-hosted runner on a Raspberry Pi 4 to build RethinkDB from source and push the image to Docker Hub.

For implementation details, see the main [RethinkDB image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rethinkdb) images and the [RethinkDB website](https://rethinkdb.com/).
